### What is a Potato?
 The [potato](Q16587531), *Solanum tuberosum*, belongs to the [Solanaceae](Q134172) family: a collection of flowering plants commonly known as nightshades. Like many other members of the nightshade family—such as tomatoes and eggplants—potatoes are laced with toxic compounds called glycoalkaloids, which early cultivators reduced through selective breeding to make them edible for humans.[^4] Curiously, unlike most crops, the portion of the potato plant used for human consumption is little more than a swollen section of the stem, known as the stolon. While the exact place of origin for the potato remains a point of debate, its native range stretches from the southwest reaches of present-day United States to the slopes of the Andes Mountains in Central Argentina.[^5] A key contributing factor to the potato’s expansive native range is its viability in nearly any soil or climate, aside from soils high in saline or alkaline materials.[^6] As a result, its ability to grow just about anywhere has made it easily adoptable into many societies around the world regardless of their geographies, from wet coastal lowlands to arid terraces high above sea level.

 The part of the plant that comes readily to mind—its carbohydrate-rich stolon extending underground—also serves an unexpected purpose: to self-propagate without sexual reproduction.[^7] Potatoes in the wild can reproduce through two different means, sexually through pollination with other potato plants or asexually through their stolons. The former increases genetic variation by allowing genes to flow between different individual potato plants, while the latter produces genetically identical offspring when environmental pressures limit the number of diverse partners available for reproduction.[^8] The potato’s capacity for asexual reproduction has been a boon for both the plant and humans alike, allowing for easy cultivation of self-propagating, nutrient-rich tubers. However, its asexual propagation does not come without risk: stagnation caused by lack of genetic diversity opens new vulnerabilities for the plant and the human populations that rely on it.[^9] Current estimates mark the potato’s domestication beginning around 10,000 years ago, when early cultivators began selecting individual wild potato plants with larger, nutrient-rich stolons and lower levels of glycoalkaloids for further propagation.[^10] As a result, what is commonly referred to as the potato plant actually consists of seven cultivated species and 228 wild species grown throughout the world, with additional varieties, caused by inter-species hybridization, stretching into the thousands.[^11]

### Pre-Columbian History
Indigenous to the Peruvian-Bolivian Andes mountains of South America, the potato has been and continues to be a vital food source for Indigenous communities while remaining vulnerable to disease. It also has had a long-standing cultural and social significance to those communities. In his book, *The History and Social Influence of the Potato*, physician and biologist Redcliffe Salaman uses archaeological materials dating back to the late-Chimu, pre-Inca, and Inca periods, roughly 1000 to 1470 CE, to show how potatoes became common motifs in pottery and earthenware. Interestingly, they were anthropomorphized as humans, with eyes and facial contours, and vice versa, as humans were rendered tuberous, with varying degrees of realism in their decorative aspects.[^12] So important was this crop that it became a part of Incan mythology and ritual, as represented by Axomamma, the divine goddess of potatoes and one of the daughters of the famous Pachamama, the Earth Mother.[^13]

Potatoes, along with corn and quinoa, became crucial food crops that Indigenous farmers and communities worked together to plant, harvest, and circulate as part of a complex system of labor and trade that helped sustain the dietary needs of populations dispersed over mountainous terrains. Andean farmers wielded tools, such as the ayacho (a mattock with blades) and taclla (a foot plough) in Quechua, to break and shift soil for the planting. The labor required to grow and harvest potatoes was formalized under the Incan Empire, in a system called mit’a (a turn or season), which required each man and woman of a community to work cooperatively by reciprocating labor and to contribute to the state.[^14]

Incan calendars depicted potato planting and harvest. This can be seen in the manuscript *First New Chronicle and Good Government (El Primer Nueva Corónica y Buen Gobierno)* written by Felipe Guamán Poma de Ayala in 1615 and included in Inca Garcilaso de la Vega’s *The Royal Commentaries of the Incas (Comentarios Reales de los Incas)*. Three months of the year were notable for potato planting and harvest: January, June, and December. De la Vega detailed that January was the month for "work in the potato fields; a man and woman are seen with hoes in their hands." In June, "potatoes are dug with spades." And in December, "the potatoes and quinoa are planted." The illustration for December "shows a peasant being helped by a woman to make a hole in the earth with a spade driven in by a mallet, while a second woman is preparing to place a potato in it."[^15]

### Manzanar War Relocation Center
 The potato’s ability to take root in places where other crops cannot find purchase results in it appearing in unexpected moments in human history. An example of this is captured in American photographer Ansel Adams’ 1943 photograph of a potato harvest, *Farm, farm workers, Mt. Williamson in background, Manzanar Relocation Center, California*. Rows of tilled earth run diagonally across the frame, each attended to by individuals sheltering from the sun under their wide-brimmed hats. In the distance, mountains crest as though they, too, were dug by a great plow coursing through the earth—if only we could stand upon their heights, perhaps we would be met with continuing rows of peaks and troughs just like the foreground. Based on the landscape, one could be forgiven for imagining this to be an image of the potato’s ancestral fields in the foothills of the Andes. And yet, the photograph’s title tells us otherwise. As is often the case with the potato, this image tells a complex story of relocation and struggle in a harsh landscape. Who were these laborers, and why were they there?

[Manzanar](Q985484) was an incarceration camp in Owens Valley, California, created by the United States government for the forced relocation and detainment of Japanese Americans during the Second World War.[^52] At its peak, Manzanar held 10,046 people within the single square mile of its confines. Needing a crop that could produce a high density of nutrition in the rugged terrain of the high Sierra Mountains, the government selected the potato as one of the staple foods of the prisoners’ diet, planting it on a 118-acre field alongside a number of other crops such as melons, tomatoes, and cabbage.[^53] Adams, acclaimed for his photographs of landscapes and natural scenes, visited Manzanar four times between 1943 and 1944. What he doesn’t include in his photographs are the barbed wire fences and guard towers that encircled life within Manzanar.

The potato was a locus of agricultural labor and sustenance for Japanese Americans in California even prior to their forced incarceration. For example, images such as Dorthea Lange’s 1942 photograph, *Stockton, Calif. Apr. 1942. Cutting potato seed on an industrialized farm where, before evacuation, persons of Japanese ancestry did all the work* captures the centrality of the crop to the geography of the American West and the communities within it. As Japanese Americans were forcibly relocated to camps in the High Sierras, the potato was made to follow.

 The potato and the materials surrounding its production became a mainstay of life in all the Japanese incarceration camps—not only as a source of food but also as a source for artistic and cultural creation. For example, in her graphic novel [*Citizen 13660*](Q64214564), depicting daily life as a prisoner in the San Bruno and Topaz camps in California and Utah, artist and writer Miné Okubo wrote that "art and hobby shows were of great interest. The residents exhibited vases and desk sets of wood, toys, stuffed animals and dolls…and beautiful hats made of citrus-fruit wrappings woven with potato-sack strings. Ingenious use was made of everything that could be found in the center."[^54] The potato and its various parts provided sustenance for the prisoners, simultaneously providing a bedrock of their diet while being interwoven into their clothing and daily-lived experiences. In her illustration *Art and hobby show, Central Utah Relocation Project, Topaz, Utah, 1942–1944*, Okubo shows how arts objects made by the prisoners out of accessible materials, such as the strings from potato sacks, were displayed and celebrated.

(Artwork also depicted in Okubo, Citizen 13660).">
  
  However, while the potato’s presence in the prisoners’ diets provided some nutritional relief against hunger, it quickly became a symbol of the claustrophobic banality of incarcerated life. Louise Ogawa—a prisoner at the [Poston Incarceration Camp](Q7234427) in Poston, Arizona—wrote often to her friend Clara Breed back home in San Diego. In one of her letters Ogawa describes a week’s worth of meals. While the inclusion of other items might superficially suggest a degree of dietary variety, Ogawa's records reveal the relentless recurrence of the potato, which was served at least twice every single day. For example, on January 16, 1943, Ogawa described the day’s meals as the following: "Breakfast: 2 strips of bacon, cup of cocoa, fried potatoes, 2 toast. Lunch: 1 hamburger, mashed potato, bread, 5 half slices of canned peaches. Supper: rice, 2 donuts, chop suey (all kinds of vegetables cooked together with shoyu), pickled vegetables."[^55] Even with other available foods, the potato in its different preparations remained an inescapable daily constant. The ubiquity of the potato was a core component of daily life in incarceration camps across America, from Ogawa’s experience in Arizona to Okubo’s in California.

While recalling her experience of going for a meal in the camp’s mess hall, Okubo wrote: "At the dishware and the silverware counter I picked up a plate, a knife, and a fork. I wiped my plate clean with my handkerchief and held it out to the first of the cooks, who was serving boiled potatoes with his hands…the entire space was filled with long tables and backless benches. Each table was supposed to accommodate eight persons, but right now each was a bedlam of hungry people. We looked for an empty place but could find none. The air was stuffy and, having temporarily lost our appetites, we decided to forget about eating."[^56] Okubo’s illustration *Inside the mess hall at Tanforan Assembly Center, San Bruno, California, 1942* captures the scene. The potato’s presence in the lives of Okubo and her fellow prisoners permeated every part of life. After long days of forced labor under the harsh California sun spent cultivating the plant—with nothing but the brims of their hats made from its shipping materials to seek shelter under—it was the boiled tubers of the potato that awaited the prisoners in cramped mess halls and narrow tables. It is no surprise Okubo lost her appetite.

### A Plant Archive of Survival
We often ask plants questions such as: Where are you native? How many variants exist? What environment do you strive in? What are you most vulnerable to? Humans ask—at times demand—these questions of plants, and the answers are held not only in science, but also by communities fighting to preserve their native plants. Each answer is a story, and more stories continue to be collected, creating a plant archive of survival. What does the plant archive of the potato tell us? In the public imagination, the potato exists within two dominant narratives.
<param ve-image
	   src="gh:JessaMaria/Potatos/main/potato/newspaper.png"
	   caption="*The Southern Herald.,* March 15, 1912. Provided by: Mississippi Department of Archives and History.">

The first narrative lies in the potato’s monoculture and consumption value as a crop, as different countries and communities have made it a vital part of their diet. As the plant scientist Tiina Särkinen wrote, "We commonly treat the plants beneficial to us—those we cultivate and depend upon—as distinct and disconnected from plant diversity in the wild. But our crops all have their origins in wild biodiversity and have wild ancestors."[^57] The *how* or *when* behind the movement of a plant’s "wild ancestors" across the globe isn’t always easy to pinpoint. Still, the effects of its cross-cultivation transform a plant’s ability to survive.

	   caption="Mercado Modelo de Huancayo Peru- Solanum tuberosum variedades. Source: Thayne Tuason.">

The second narrative centers on famine and the risk of monoculture, both to biodiversity and to communities that have become dependent on the monocrop. Beyond the Irish famine, there are other lesser-known moments when the infection of potato crops caused famine, otherwise known as late blight, that decimated potatoes: in 1843 Pennsylvania, 1921 Soviet Union, and 2003 Papua New Guinea. Given the potato’s vulnerability to disease and climate change, "community conservationists of the Potato Park [in Peru] decided in 2011 to send more than 1,500 seed samples of their own varieties to be stored in the *Svalbard Global Seed Vault*."[^58] Communities and countries within Latin America are taking steps to protect the potato’s many variants. The International Potato Center (CIP), whose main headquarters is in Peru, works with more than twenty countries across Africa, Asia, and Latin America to enhance food security.

### A Plant Archive of Resistance: the Edinburgh Potato
Along with the collection of seed samples, research across the globe to find a blight-resistant gene through networks similar to the CIP has been ongoing in Peru, Chile, Mexico, the Philippines, Lithuania, and sub-Saharan Africa.[^59] And another research effort in the fight against the potato’s late blight is being conducted in Edinburgh, Scotland. Due to the "understandable interest in the Edinburgh potato given its proven resistance to late blight over many years," a collaboration between the James Hutton Institute, the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh and SASA, have "recreated the Edinburgh potato (Solanum × edinense) by controlled crossing of the cultivated potato with the wild species Solanum demissum found naturally in Mexico.[^60] The fight to find a genetically resistant variant to blight, through a "controlled crossing" using this wild species from Mexico, creates an ongoing and shifting story of plant resistance. If we consider potatoes and their movement, in this case, the wild species from Mexico into Edinburgh, as a form of plant travel narratives, then we can read their histories of blight not necessarily as being antithetical to an archive of survival, but as being one of resistance to disease and decimation.
<param ve-image

	   caption="Distribution of the *Solanum Tuberosum.* Source: Global Biodiversity Information Facility.">

Such "controlled crossings" can be applied to what Carmen Lamas has called the "Latinx return" or "Latin American return," which charts "an endless circuit of arrivals and departures" across existing divides. In her book, The Latino Continuum and the Nineteenth-Century Americas, Lamas explains how, when studying or recovering the lives and experiences of Latinx people, "we find markers—geographic, political, affective, aesthetic, and imaginative—that speak to the comings and goings of Latin Americans to the U.S. and back again to their home countries… They all speak of what I call the Latinx return, an endless circuit of arrivals and departures."[^61] Lamas reminds us that the crossing of the divide does not only have to involve an actual person returning, but also in the circulation of the translated works Latin American authors have published within the United States and Latin America, and more.
<param ve-image

	   caption="Map of Mexico.">

Potatoes and the fight to find a genetically resistant variant begs whether the "Latino continuum" can be more-than-human—one found within the texts of plants that are neither entirely Latin American nor European. Gardens, deserts, and the environment are storied archives. When we read each plant and ecosystem as a text, their narratives reflect a historical coming and going. The wild species being brought from Mexico and cultivated to recreate a resistant Edinburgh potato not only offers the chance to read a different "Latin American return" outside of the geographical area of the Americas. But also one that extends beyond published texts and people who return to their country of origin, to include plants. The duration for which the Edinburgh potato will remain resistant is unknown, and scientific research conducted in Edinburgh is ongoing. Research to cultivate a resistant potato will hopefully also benefit not only Latin American countries but also other countries in need, and be conducted collaboratively within their communities.
