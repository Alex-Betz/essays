  ### What is a Potato?
 
 The potato, or *Solanum tuberosum*, belongs to the Solanaceae family: a collection of flowering plants more commonly known as nightshades. Like many other members of the nightshade family—such as tomatoes and eggplants—potatoes are laced with toxic compounds called glycoalkaloids, which early cultivators reduced through selective breeding to make them edible for humans.[^4] Curiously, unlike most other crops, the portion of the potato plant used for human consumption is little more than a swollen section of the stem, known as the stolon. While the exact place of origin for the potato remains a point of debate, their native range stretches all the way from the southwest reaches of the present-day United States to the slopes of the Andes Mountains in Central Argentina.[^5] A key contributing factor to the potato’s expansive native range is its viability in nearly any soil or climate, aside from soils high in saline or alkaline materials.[^6] As a result, the potato’s ability to grow just about anywhere has made it easily adoptable into many societies around the world regardless of their geographies, from wet coastal lowlands to arid terraces high above sea level.

The part of the plant that comes readily to mind—its carbohydrate-rich stem extending underground—also serves an unexpected purpose: the ability to self-propagate without sexual reproduction.[^7] Potatoes in the wild can thus reproduce through two different means, sexually through pollination with other potato plants or asexually through their stolons. The former increases genetic variation by allowing genes to flow between different individual potato plants, while the latter produces genetically identical offspring when environmental pressures limit the number of diverse partners available for reproduction.[^8] The potato’s capacity for asexual reproduction has been a boon for both the plant and humans alike, allowing for easy cultivation of self-propagating, nutrient-rich tubers. However, its asexual propagation does not come without risk: stagnation caused by subsequent lack of genetic diversity opens up new vulnerabilities for the plant and the human populations who rely on it.[^9] Current estimates mark the potato’s domestication beginning around 10,000 years ago, when early cultivators began selecting individual wild potato plants with larger, nutrient-rich stolons and lower levels of glycoalkaloids for further propagation.[^10] As a result, what is commonly referred to as the potato plant actually consists of seven cultivated species and 228 wild species grown throughout the world, with additional varieties caused by inter-species hybridization stretching into the thousands.[^11]

 I want to write about the *potato.* In particular, the **potato**. In fact, let me link you to it right [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potato).[^1]
 Here is an example of a [QID usage](Q16587531).
 And now I am going to do a footnote!
 Wikipedia begins with the following block quote:
 >The potato is a starchy tuberous vegetable.[^2]

This is the end of that paragraph.

Here is the second paragraph.

This is the fourth paragraph, and I want to display a primary source from archive.org
