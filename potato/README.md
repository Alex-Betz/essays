  ### What is a Potato?
 
 The potato, *Solanum tuberosum*, belongs to the Solanaceae family: a collection of flowering plants commonly known as nightshades. Like many other members of the nightshade family—such as tomatoes and eggplants—potatoes are laced with toxic compounds called glycoalkaloids, which early cultivators reduced through selective breeding to make them edible for humans.[^4] Curiously, unlike most crops, the portion of the potato plant used for human consumption is little more than a swollen section of the stem, known as the stolon. While the exact place of origin for the potato remains a point of debate, its native range stretches from the southwest reaches of present-day United States to the slopes of the Andes Mountains in Central Argentina.[^5] A key contributing factor to the potato’s expansive native range is its viability in nearly any soil or climate, aside from soils high in saline or alkaline materials.[^6] As a result, its ability to grow just about anywhere has made it easily adoptable into many societies around the world regardless of their geographies, from wet coastal lowlands to arid terraces high above sea level.

 The part of the plant that comes readily to mind—its carbohydrate-rich stolon extending underground—also serves an unexpected purpose: to self-propagate without sexual reproduction. [^7] Potatoes in the wild can reproduce through two different means, sexually through pollination with other potato plants or asexually through their stolons. The former increases genetic variation by allowing genes to flow between different individual potato plants, while the latter produces genetically identical offspring when environmental pressures limit the number of diverse partners available for reproduction. [^8] The potato’s capacity for asexual reproduction has been a boon for both the plant and humans alike, allowing for easy cultivation of self-propagating, nutrient-rich tubers. However, its asexual propagation does not come without risk: stagnation caused by lack of genetic diversity opens new vulnerabilities for the plant and the human populations that rely on it.[^9] Current estimates mark the potato’s domestication beginning around 10,000 years ago, when early cultivators began selecting individual wild potato plants with larger, nutrient-rich stolons and lower levels of glycoalkaloids for further propagation. [^10] As a result, what is commonly referred to as the potato plant actually consists of seven cultivated species and 228 wild species grown throughout the world, with additional varieties, caused by inter-species hybridization, stretching into the thousands.

 ### Manzanar War Relocation Center

 The potato’s ability to take root in places where other crops cannot find purchase results in it appearing in unexpected moments in human history. An example of this is captured in American photographer Ansel Adams’ 1943 photograph of a potato harvest, *Farm, farm workers, Mt. Williamson in background, Manzanar Relocation Center, California*. Rows of tilled earth run diagonally across the frame, each attended to by individuals sheltering from the sun under their wide-brimmed hats. In the distance, mountains crest as though they, too, were dug by a great plow coursing through the earth—if only we could stand upon their heights, perhaps we would be met with continuing rows of peaks and troughs just like the foreground. Based on the landscape, one could be forgiven for imagining this to be an image of the potato’s ancestral fields in the foothills of the Andes. And yet, the photograph’s title tells us otherwise. As is often the case with the potato, this image tells a complex story of relocation and struggle in a harsh landscape. Who were these laborers, and why were they there?

Manzanar was an incarceration camp in Owens Valley, California, created by the United States government for the forced relocation and detainment of Japanese Americans during the Second World War. [^52] At its peak, Manzanar held 10,046 people within the single square mile of its confines. Needing a crop that could produce a high density of nutrition in the rugged terrain of the high Sierra Mountains, the government selected the potato as one of the staple foods of the prisoners’ diet, planting it on a 118-acre field alongside a number of other crops such as melons, tomatoes, and cabbage. [^53] Adams, acclaimed for his photographs of landscapes and natural scenes, visited Manzanar four times between 1943 and 1944. What he doesn’t include in his photographs are the barbed wire fences and guard towers that encircled life within Manzanar.

The potato was a locus of agricultural labor and sustenance for Japanese Americans in California even prior to their forced incarceration. For example, images such as Dorthea Lange’s 1942 photograph, *Stockton, Calif. Apr. 1942. Cutting potato seed on an industrialized farm where, before evacuation, persons of Japanese ancestry did all the work* captures the centrality of the crop to the geography of the American West and the communities within it. As Japanese Americans were forcibly relocated to camps in the High Sierras, the potato was made to follow.

 The potato and the materials surrounding its production became a mainstay of life in all the Japanese incarceration camps—not only as a source of food but also as a source for artistic and cultural creation. For example, in her graphic novel *Citizen 13660*, depicting daily life as a prisoner in the San Bruno and Topaz camps in California and Utah, artist and writer Miné Okubo wrote that "art and hobby shows were of great interest. The residents exhibited vases and desk sets of wood, toys, stuffed animals and dolls…and beautiful hats made of citrus-fruit wrappings woven with potato-sack strings. Ingenious use was made of everything that could be found in the center." [^54] The potato and its various parts provided sustenance for the prisoners, simultaneously providing a bedrock of their diet while being interwoven into their clothing and daily-lived experiences. In her illustration *Art and hobby show, Central Utah Relocation Project, Topaz, Utah, 1942–1944*, Okubo shows how arts objects made by the prisoners out of accessible materials, such as the strings from potato sacks, were displayed and celebrated.

(Artwork also depicted in Okubo, Citizen 13660).">
  
  However, while the potato’s presence in the prisoners’ diets provided some nutritional relief against hunger, it quickly became a symbol of the claustrophobic banality of incarcerated life. Louise Ogawa—a prisoner at the Poston Incarceration Camp in Poston, Arizona—wrote often to her friend Clara Breed back home in San Diego. In one of her letters Ogawa describes a week’s worth of meals. While the inclusion of other items might superficially suggest a degree of dietary variety, Ogawa's records reveal the relentless recurrence of the potato, which was served at least twice every single day. For example, on January 16, 1943, Ogawa described the day’s meals as the following: "Breakfast: 2 strips of bacon, cup of cocoa, fried potatoes, 2 toast. Lunch: 1 hamburger, mashed potato, bread, 5 half slices of canned peaches. Supper: rice, 2 donuts, chop suey (all kinds of vegetables cooked together with shoyu), pickled vegetables." [^55] Even with other available foods, the potato in its different preparations remained an inescapable daily constant. The ubiquity of the potato was a core component of daily life in incarceration camps across America, from Ogawa’s experience in Arizona to Okubo’s in California. <param ve-image manifest="gh:Alex-Betz/essays/potato/Ogawa.jpg" caption="Louise Ogawa, *Letter to Clara Breed from Louise Ogawa, Poston, Arizona, January 27, 1943 [page four]*, January 27, 1943.

While recalling her experience of going for a meal in the camp’s mess hall, Okubo wrote: "At the dishware and the silverware counter I picked up a plate, a knife, and a fork. I wiped my plate clean with my handkerchief and held it out to the first of the cooks, who was serving boiled potatoes with his hands…the entire space was filled with long tables and backless benches. Each table was supposed to accommodate eight persons, but right now each was a bedlam of hungry people. We looked for an empty place but could find none. The air was stuffy and, having temporarily lost our appetites, we decided to forget about eating." [^56] Okubo’s illustration *Inside the mess hall at Tanforan Assembly Center, San Bruno, California, 1942* captures the scene. The potato’s presence in the lives of Okubo and her fellow prisoners permeated every part of life. After long days of forced labor under the harsh California sun spent cultivating the plant—with nothing but the brims of their hats made from its shipping materials to seek shelter under—it was the boiled tubers of the potato that awaited the prisoners in cramped mess halls and narrow tables. It is no surprise Okubo lost her appetite. <param ve-image manifest="gh:Alex-Betz/essays/potato/OkuboMess.jpg" caption="Miné Okubo, Inside the mess hall at Tanforan Assembly Center, San Bruno, California, 1942.
