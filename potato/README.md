  ### Introduction
 
 I want to write about the *potato.* In particular, the **potato**. In fact, let me link you to it right [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potato).[^1]
 Here is an example of a [QID usage](Q16587531).
 And now I am going to do a footnote!
 Wikipedia begins with the following block quote:
 >The potato is a starchy tuberous vegetable.[^2]

This is the end of that paragraph.

	   caption="This is an image of the flowering part of a potato!">

Here is the second paragraph.
<param ve-image
	   src="gh:Alex-Betz/essays/main/potato/bakedpotato.jpg">

This is the fourth paragraph, and I want to display a primary source from archive.org
<param ve-iframe
