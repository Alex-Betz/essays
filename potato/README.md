  ### What is a Potato?
 
 The potato, or *Solanum tuberosum*, belongs to the Solanaceae family: a collection of flowering plants more commonly known as nightshades. Like many other members of the nightshade family—such as tomatoes and eggplants—potatoes are laced with toxic compounds called glycoalkaloids, which early cultivators reduced through selective breeding to make them edible for humans.[^4] Curiously, unlike most other crops, the portion of the potato plant used for human consumption is little more than a swollen section of the stem, known as the stolon. While the exact place of origin for the potato remains a point of debate, their native range stretches all the way from the southwest reaches of the present-day United States to the slopes of the Andes Mountains in Central Argentina.[^5] A key contributing factor to the potato’s expansive native range is its viability in nearly any soil or climate, aside from soils high in saline or alkaline materials.[^6] As a result, the potato’s ability to grow just about anywhere has made it easily adoptable into many societies around the world regardless of their geographies, from wet coastal lowlands to arid terraces high above sea level.

 I want to write about the *potato.* In particular, the **potato**. In fact, let me link you to it right [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potato).[^1]
 Here is an example of a [QID usage](Q16587531).
 And now I am going to do a footnote!
 Wikipedia begins with the following block quote:
 >The potato is a starchy tuberous vegetable.[^2]

This is the end of that paragraph.

Here is the second paragraph.

This is the fourth paragraph, and I want to display a primary source from archive.org
