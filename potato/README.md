  ### What is a Potato?
 
 The potato, *Solanum tuberosum*, belongs to the Solanaceae family: a collection of flowering plants commonly known as nightshades. Like many other members of the nightshade family—such as tomatoes and eggplants—potatoes are laced with toxic compounds called glycoalkaloids, which early cultivators reduced through selective breeding to make them edible for humans.[^4] Curiously, unlike most crops, the portion of the potato plant used for human consumption is little more than a swollen section of the stem, known as the stolon. While the exact place of origin for the potato remains a point of debate, its native range stretches from the southwest reaches of present-day United States to the slopes of the Andes Mountains in Central Argentina.[^5] A key contributing factor to the potato’s expansive native range is its viability in nearly any soil or climate, aside from soils high in saline or alkaline materials.[^6] As a result, its ability to grow just about anywhere has made it easily adoptable into many societies around the world regardless of their geographies, from wet coastal lowlands to arid terraces high above sea level.

 The part of the plant that comes readily to mind—its carbohydrate-rich stolon extending underground—also serves an unexpected purpose: to self-propagate without sexual reproduction. [^7] Potatoes in the wild can reproduce through two different means, sexually through pollination with other potato plants or asexually through their stolons. The former increases genetic variation by allowing genes to flow between different individual potato plants, while the latter produces genetically identical offspring when environmental pressures limit the number of diverse partners available for reproduction. [^8] The potato’s capacity for asexual reproduction has been a boon for both the plant and humans alike, allowing for easy cultivation of self-propagating, nutrient-rich tubers. However, its asexual propagation does not come without risk: stagnation caused by lack of genetic diversity opens new vulnerabilities for the plant and the human populations that rely on it.[^9] Current estimates mark the potato’s domestication beginning around 10,000 years ago, when early cultivators began selecting individual wild potato plants with larger, nutrient-rich stolons and lower levels of glycoalkaloids for further propagation. [^10] As a result, what is commonly referred to as the potato plant actually consists of seven cultivated species and 228 wild species grown throughout the world, with additional varieties, caused by inter-species hybridization, stretching into the thousands.

 ### Manzanar War Relocation Center

 The potato’s ability to take root in places where other crops cannot find purchase causes it to show up at unexpected moments in human history. An example of this is captured in American photographer Ansel Adams’ 1943 photograph, entitled *Farm, farm workers, Mt. Williamson in background, Manzanar Relocation Center, California*. This is an image of a potato harvest. Rows of tilled earth run diagonally across the frame, each attended to by individuals sheltering from the sun under their wide-brimmed hats. Far away in the distance, mountains crest as though they, too, were dug by a great plow coursing through the earth—if only we could stand upon their heights, perhaps we would be met with continuing rows of peaks and troughs just like the foreground. Based on the landscape, one could be forgiven for imagining this to be an image of the potato’s ancestral fields in the foothills of the Andes. And yet, the title tells us otherwise. As is often the case with the potato, this image, too, is a complex story of relocation and struggle in a harsh landscape. Who were these laborers, and why were they there?

 Adams, acclaimed for his photographs of landscapes and natural scenes, paid four visits to Manzanar in central California between 1943 and 1944. Manzanar was an incarceration camp created by the United States government for the forced relocation and detainment of Japanese Americans during the Second World War.[^52] At its peak, Manzanar held 10,046 people within the single square mile of its confines. Needing a crop that could produce a high density of nutrition in the rugged terrain of the high Sierra Mountains, the United States government selected the potato as one of the staple foods of the prisoners’ diet, planting it on a 118-acre field alongside a number of other crops such as melons, tomatoes, and cabbage.[^53] What is missing from Adams’ photograph of the agricultural fields just outside of the camp’s confines are the barbed wire fences and guard towers that encircled all life within Manzanar. The potato was a core locus of agricultural labor and sustenance for Japanese Americans in California even prior to their forced incarceration. For example, images such as Dorthea Lange’s 1942 photograph entitled Stockton, Calif. Apr. 1942. Cutting potato seed on an industrialized farm where, before evacuation, persons of Japanese ancestry did all the work captures the centrality of the crop to the geography of the American Southwest and the communities within it. As Japanese Americans were forcibly relocated to camps in the High Sierras, the potato was made to follow.

 The potato and the materials surrounding its production became a mainstay of life in the incarceration camps—not only as a source of food but also as a source for artistic and cultural creation. For example, Miné Okubo, who was a prisoner in the San Bruno and Topaz camps in California and Utah, wrote in her retrospective book "Citizen 13660" that "art and hobby shows were of great interest. The residents exhibited vases and desk sets of wood, toys, stuffed animals and dolls…and beautiful hats made of citrus-fruit wrappings woven with potato-sack strings. Ingenious use was made of everything that could be found in the center."54 The potato and its various parts provided sustenance for the prisoners, simultaneously providing a bedrock of their diet while being interwoven into their clothing and daily lived experiences. Okubo, as part of her text, illustrated scenes of daily life. In her illustration Art and hobby show, Central Utah Relocation Project, Topaz, Utah, 1942-1944, Okubo shows where arts objects made by the prisoners out of accessible materials, such as the strings from potato sacks, were displayed and celebrated. 
 
 I want to write about the *potato.* In particular, the **potato**. In fact, let me link you to it right [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potato).[^1]
 Here is an example of a [QID usage](Q16587531).
 And now I am going to do a footnote!
 Wikipedia begins with the following block quote:
 >The potato is a starchy tuberous vegetable.[^2]
